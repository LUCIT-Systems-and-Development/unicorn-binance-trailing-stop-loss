If you put this bot on a market, you should stop trading manually on this market yourself!

To work with `ubtsl` you have to open a shell/terminal/console window like `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`!

If you want to use the config and profiles ini files, then run these commands after the installation in a terminal:
$ ubtsl --createconfigini
$ ubtsl --createprofilesini

Please read carefully all provided documentation before using this tool and use it at your own risk:
