## Get a UNICORN Binance Suite License

To run modules of the *UNICORN Binance Suite* you need a [valid license](https://medium.lucit.tech/how-to-obtain-and-use-a-unicorn-binance-suite-license-key-and-run-the-ubs-module-according-to-best-87b0088124a8#4ca4)!

## How to start the trailing stop loss engine:
```

ubtsl.stop_manager()
```

[Discover more possibilities](https://unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_trailing_stop_loss.html).

## Start the engine on the command line (Windows, Linux and Mac):
```
$ ubtsl --profile BTCUSDT_SELL --stoplosslimit 0.5%
```

Read about the [CLI usage](https://www.lucit.tech/ubtsl-cli.html).

## Description
The Python package [UNICORN Binance Trailing Stop Loss](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.html) 
provides a reuseable library and [CLI interface](https://www.lucit.tech/ubtsl-cli.html).

After starting the engine, a stop/loss order is placed on Binance and trailed until it is completely fulfilled. If desired, a 
notification can be sent via email and Telegram afterwards. Then it calls the function 
passed with the `callback_finished` parameter or on error it calls the function passed to `callback_error`. 

Partially filled orders are currently not handled by the engine. If you want to react individually to this event, you 
can use the function provided to `callback_partially_filled`.

In addition, there is a [smart entry](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.html#smart-entry) option 
called `jump-in-and-trail`. This offers the possibility to buy spot, future and margin assets with a limit or market 
order and then to trail a stop/loss order until sold.

### What are the benefits of the UNICORN Binance Trailing Stop Loss?
- Using websockets for push notifications about price updates and order status updates. (Fast data transfer and low 
used API weight!)
- [Smart entry](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.html#smart-entry)
- Supported exchanges: 

| Exchange                                           | Exchange string               | trail                                                                                                                                     | jump-in-and-trail                                                                                                                                        |

- Integrated notification system (e-Mail and Telegram).
- Test "notification", "binance-connectivity" and "streams" without starting the engine.
- Powered by [UNICORN Binance REST API](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-rest-api.html) and 
[UNICORN Binance WebSocket API](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-websocket-api.html).

### Smart entry
***This function is still in an experimental phase and only available for Isolated Margin.***

Do a smart entry by using `engine = 'jump-in-and-trail'` and providing `borrow_threshold`.

By activating the `jump-in-and-trail` engine, the engine first buys the predefined asset amount and then trails them 
automatically. 

## Installation and Upgrade
The module requires Python 3.7 or above, as it depends on Pythons latest asyncio features for asynchronous/concurrent 
processing. 

For the PyPy interpreter we offer packages only from Python version 3.9 and higher.

Anaconda packages are available from Python version 3.8 and higher.

The current dependencies are listed [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss/blob/master/requirements.txt).

If you run into errors during the installation take a look [here](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss/wiki/Installation).

### A Cython binary, PyPy or source code based CPython wheel of the latest version with `pip` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/unicorn-binance-rest-api/)
Our [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) Wheels are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), 
these wheels offer significant advantages for Python developers:
- ***Performance Boost with Cython Wheels:*** 
  Cython is a programming language that supplements Python with static typing and C-level performance. By compiling 
  Python code into C, Cython Wheels can significantly enhance the execution speed of Python code, especially in 
  computationally intensive tasks. This means faster runtimes and more efficient processing for users of our package. 
- ***PyPy Wheels for Enhanced Efficiency:*** 
  PyPy is an alternative Python interpreter known for its speed and efficiency. It uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, 
  which can dramatically improve the performance of Python code. Our PyPy Wheels are tailored for compatibility with 
  PyPy, allowing users to leverage this speed advantage seamlessly.

Both Cython and PyPy Wheels on PyPI make the installation process simpler and more straightforward. They ensure that 
you get the optimized version of our package with minimal setup, allowing you to focus on development rather than 
configuration.
