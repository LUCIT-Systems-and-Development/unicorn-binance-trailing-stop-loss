A Python library with a [command line interface](https://www.lucit.tech/ubtsl-cli.html) for a trailing stop loss on 
Binance Exchange in a easy, fast, flexible, robust and fully-featured way.

As [`UNICORN Binance Trailing Stop Loss Bot`](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss-bot.html)
we also offer a standalone version that does not require an installed Python environment.

Please read carefully all provided documentation before using this lib!

If you put this engine on a market, you should stop trading manually on this market yourself!

Part of ['UNICORN Binance Suite'](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-suite.html).

## How to start the trailing stop loss engine:
```
import unicorn_binance_trailing_stop_loss


def callback_error(msg):
    print(f"STOP LOSS ERROR - ENGINE IS SHUTTING DOWN! - {msg}")
    ubtsl.stop_manager()

def callback_finished(msg):
    print(f"STOP LOSS FINISHED - ENGINE IS SHUTTING DOWN! - {msg}")
    ubtsl.stop_manager()
    
    
ubtsl = unicorn_binance_trailing_stop_loss.BinanceTrailingStopLossManager(callback_error=callback_error,
                                                                          callback_finished=callback_finished,
                                                                          binance_public_key="aaa",
                                                                          binance_private_key="bbb",

                                                                          send_from_email_server="mail.example.com",
                                                                          send_from_email_port=25,

                                                                          stop_loss_order_type="LIMIT",
                                                                          stop_loss_price=88,
                                                                          stop_loss_side="SELL",
                                                                          telegram_bot_token="telegram_bot_token",

```

### Stop the engine:
```
ubtsl.stop_manager()
```

### Get the right [logger](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss/blob/master/example_logging.py):
```
logging.getLogger("unicorn_binance_trailing_stop_loss")
```

[Discover more possibilities](https://unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_trailing_stop_loss.html).

## Start the engine on the command line (Windows, Linux and Mac):
```
$ ubtsl --profile LUNAUSDT_SELL --stoplosslimit 0.5%
```

Read about the [CLI usage](https://www.lucit.tech/ubtsl-cli.html).

## Description
The Python package [UNICORN Binance Trailing Stop Loss](https://www.lucit.tech/unicorn-binance-trailing-stop-loss.html) 
provides a reuseable library and [CLI interface](https://www.lucit.tech/ubtsl-cli.html).

Once the engine is started, it trails the stop/loss order until it is completely fulfilled and then calls the function 
passed with the `callback_finished` parameter. On error it calls the function passed to `callback_error`.

### What are the benefits of the UNICORN Binance Trailing Stop Loss?
